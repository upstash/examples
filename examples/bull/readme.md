  <h3 align="center">Using Bull with Upstash</h3>

  <p align="center">   
    A Bull Queue powered by Redis for processing video transcoding jobs with customizable settings and job management capabilities.
  </p>
</div>
                                                                                
Configure `stalledInterval`, `guardInterval` and `drainDelay` for efficient use of bandwidth.

See [the Bull docs](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queue) for details about the advanced configuration parameters.

```javascript
var settings = {
  // lockDuration: 30000, // Key expiration time for job locks.
  // lockRenewTime: 15000, // Interval on which to acquire the job lock
  // maxStalledCount: 1, // Max amount of times a stalled job will be re-processed.
  // retryProcessDelay: 5000, // delay before processing next job in case of internal error.
  // backoffStrategies: {}, // A set of custom backoff strategies keyed by name.
  stalledInterval: 300000, // How often check for stalled jobs (use 0 for never checking).
  guardInterval: 300000, // Poll interval for delayed jobs and added jobs.
  drainDelay: 300, // A timeout for when the queue is in drained state (empty waiting for jobs).
};
var videoQueue = new Queue("video transcoding", "YOUR_REDIS_URL", {
  settings: settings,
});
```
