Welcome! This example showcases an interactive messaging platform that harnesses the power of Upstash Kafka, Upstash Redis, and Next.js. Through this example, you will gain hands-on experience in utilizing Upstash Redis and Upstash Kafka for a robust real-time communication system and learn to integrate various technologies with Upstash.

## Demo

To see the demo version of this project, please navigate to [here](https://next-message.fly.dev/).

You can also build your own demo following the [blogpost of this project](https://upstash.com/blog/next-chatapp-with-kafka). It describes the development and deployment process in detail.

## Project Overview

The goal of this example is to develop a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate through multiple clients, each with a unique username. The application consists of two main pages: client registration and chat room.

### Client Registration

The client registration page allows users to create multiple clients, each with a unique username. Upon clicking a client's username, users are directed to a dedicated chat room associated with that specific client.

### Chat Room

The chat room page enables real-time communication between clients. When users click on a client's username and enter a chat room, they can send and receive messages in real time. Users can also access the history of the chatroom.

### Application Logic

The chat application's logic is as follows:

-   Users create multiple clients on the index page, each with a unique username.
-   Clicking on a client's username opens a new tab with a separate client and a unique path.
-   Each client establishes a WebSocket connection to a message server.
-   Messages sent from a client are directed to the associated message server via WebSocket.
-   Message servers handle the message traffic by routing messages to a Kafka Broker.
-   Each message server runs a Node.js thread to manage incoming messages.
-   Consumed messages from Kafka are sent to clients through WebSocket connections.
-   The react-use-websocket library is used to consume incoming messages on the client side.

### Data Storage

Upstash Redis: The application utilizes Upstash Redis to store message history. Messages produced to Kafka are also persisted in the Redis database. Old messages are retrieved from Upstash Redis upon creating a new client and are displayed in the chat interface.

### Deployment

The current version of this example is deployed to Fly.io. You can check out the [blogpost](https://upstash.com/blog/next-chatapp-with-kafka) to learn about the deployment process.
